# Super Web Dev Lesson Plan
## Please follow the filesystem as follows:
- Create a new directory for each new lesson.
- Create a .md file.
- Give the structural code, such as files and folders, and media if required in a folder called web. (This will be given at the start of class)
- Put any sample code into a folder called completed.
