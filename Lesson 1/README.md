# Lesson Plan
1. Revision of tags such as `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>` and `<li>`.
2. Distribute file skeleton "web" given on a USB on to Desktop. Make sure the mentor does this themself, to make sure it is done properly.
 - make sure each mentor has this on their USB before the class.
3. Revise skeleton structure for HTML, such as default tags required, etc.
4. Write basic HTML.
5. Add `<h1>` and `<h2>` and `<p>` tags and enter text.
6. In the paragraphs, make use of `<b>` and `<i>` for bold and italic text. 
7. Add picture of cow. Ignore dimensions, may be too complicated for now. `<img src="media/cow.jpg"></img>`.
8. Add the video clip. `<video src="media/cow.mp4" controls>Your browser does not support mp4, tell one of the mentors.</video>`.
9. Add the audio clip. `<audio src="media/moo.mp3" controls></audio>`.
10. Note that if the video doesn't work, it may have to be given specified dimensions, with `width=1280 height=720`.
11. Add an unordered list and an ordered list.
